ALGOLISTO
=========

Hi Visitor ! Welcome !

This website could be considered as my memorybox or toolbox for my everyday working life. I was tired of searching again and again the same things online: "How to install tensorflow with CUDA", "animation matplotlib", "multiprocessing python", etc... things I already did a lot of times but because of the time elapsed in between each project I just forget it. So now, everytime I'm learning something new and I know I might be led to using it in the future, I will try to add it here.

For each page in this documentation, instead of a full explanation, most of the time, I'm trying to write a simple example that helps understanding the basics.

I used the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ documentation Generator because it's easy to use and it generates a refine and clear documentation, especially when using the `Read the Docs <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ Theme.

I'm working on Linux (Ubuntu based) machines, so there *might* be errors on Windows for some codes if there are OS features dependencies.

Please feel free to contact me if:

- You spotted mistakes
- You saw part of a code not optimized at all
- I forgot to quote sources
- Whatever other reasons :)
